## Theoretical Foundation

### 1. Evolution of Data Types
The progression of data types reflects the evolution of computing and business needs:

1. **Early Days (1960s-1980s)**:
   - Primarily structured data
   - Dominated by relational databases
   - Focus on business transactions

2. **Web Era (1990s-2000s)**:
   - Introduction of semi-structured data
   - Rise of XML and later JSON
   - Need for flexible data exchange

3. **Big Data Era (2010s-Present)**:
   - Explosion of unstructured data
   - Social media and IoT revolution
   - Multi-model databases

### 2. Detailed Analysis of Data Types

#### 2.1 Structured Data
**Definition**: Data that adheres to a pre-defined data model and is organized in a highly-organized and formatted manner.

**Characteristics**:
- Fixed schema definition
- Clear data types and relationships
- Follows tabular format
- Strong data consistency
- ACID properties support
- Predictable storage requirements

**Storage Systems**:
1. *Relational Databases*:
   - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
   - Uses SQL for querying
   - Strong referential integrity

2. *Data Warehouses*:
   - Snowflake, Teradata
   - Optimized for analytics
   - Column-oriented storage

**Real-world Examples**:
1. Banking Systems:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Transactions (
       TransactionID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       AccountID INT,
       TransactionType VARCHAR(10),
       Amount DECIMAL(10,2),
       TransactionDate DATETIME
   );
   ```

2. HR Systems:
   - Employee records
   - Payroll data
   - Attendance records

**Advantages**:
- Easy to search and analyze
- Efficient storage
- Strong consistency
- Mature tools and expertise

**Disadvantages**:
- Rigid schema
- Expensive to modify
- Limited flexibility
- Not suitable for all data types

#### 2.2 Semi-structured Data
**Definition**: Data that has some organizational properties but doesn't conform to a rigid structure like structured data.

**Characteristics**:
- Flexible schema
- Self-describing
- Hierarchical relationships
- Tags or markers for elements
- Variable storage requirements

**Storage Systems**:
1. *Document Stores*:
   - MongoDB, CouchDB
   - JSON/BSON format
   - Flexible schema

2. *XML Databases*:
   - BaseX, eXist-db
   - XQuery support
   - Document-centric

**Real-world Examples**:
1. E-commerce Product Catalog:
   ```json
   {
     "product": {
       "name": "Smartphone",
       "variants": [
         {
           "color": "black",
           "storage": "128GB",
           "price": 799.99
         },
         {
           "color": "white",
           "storage": "256GB",
           "price": 899.99
         }
       ],
       "specifications": {
         "screen": "6.1 inch",
         "battery": "4000mAh",
         "camera": {
           "rear": "48MP",
           "front": "12MP"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Email Systems:
   ```xml
   <email>
     <header>
       <from>sender@example.com</from>
       <to>recipient@example.com</to>
       <subject>Meeting Schedule</subject>
     </header>
     <body>
       <content>Meeting at 2 PM</content>
       <attachments>
         <file>schedule.pdf</file>
       </attachments>
     </body>
   </email>
   ```

**Advantages**:
- Flexible structure
